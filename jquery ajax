dfdjQuery load() Method
The jQuery load() method is a simple, but powerful AJAX method.

The load() method loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element.

Syntax:

$(selector).load(URL,data,callback);
The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to load.

The optional data parameter specifies a set of querystring key/value pairs to send along with the request.

The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed after the load() method is completed.
